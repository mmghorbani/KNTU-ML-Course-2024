## Question 2
Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise in training agents to make decisions by maximizing cumulative rewards. In this project, we apply two popular RL algorithms, DQN and DDQN, to the Lunar Lander environment. The key objectives are to analyze and compare the performance of these algorithms with different batch sizes and to visualize the agent's behavior over time.

### Key Features
- DQN and DDQN Implementation: Detailed implementation of DQN and DDQN algorithms for the Lunar Lander environment.
- Batch Size Comparison: Analysis of the impact of different batch sizes on the performance of the RL algorithms.
- Visualization: Creation of a 2D plot video to visualize the agent's behavior over selected episodes.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluation of the algorithms using various performance metrics such as cumulative reward, loss, and success rate.
- Environment Setup: Instructions to set up the required environment and dependencies for running the project.
