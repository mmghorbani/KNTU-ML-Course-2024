## Question 1
This repository features a machine learning project on the Iris dataset, encompassing data exploration, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, and classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The notebook provides visualizations and performance evaluations to demonstrate the model's capabilities.

### Key Features:
- Data Exploration: Utilizes pair plots and heatmaps for detailed data analysis.
- Feature Scaling and Dimensionality Reduction: Applies StandardScaler, PCA, and LDA techniques.
- Model Implementation: Implements SVM for classification tasks.
- Performance Evaluation: Evaluated with accuracy and F1-score metrics, including decision boundary and confusion matrix visualizations.

## Question 2
This repository features a machine learning project on credit card fraud detection using the SMOTE technique for handling class imbalance. The project covers data preprocessing, model training with a neural network, and performance evaluation, providing comprehensive visualizations and analysis to demonstrate the model's effectiveness.

### Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization of the "Amount" feature and handling missing values.
- Class Imbalance Handling: Uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance.
- Model Implementation: Trains a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Performance Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.
