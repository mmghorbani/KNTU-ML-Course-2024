# Q1
implements a simple Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) for a multi-class classification problem. The MLP consists of two layers of McCulloch-Pitts neurons with different activation functions. The code explores the use of step, sign, and ReLU activation functions and visualizes the decision boundaries for each combination.
