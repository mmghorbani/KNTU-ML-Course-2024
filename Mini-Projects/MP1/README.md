## Mini-project 1

## Question 1
This notebook focused on generating and classifying synthetic datasets using various machine-learning techniques. The notebook utilizes the make_classification function from scikit-learn to create a dataset with 1000 samples, 4 classes, and 3 features. It then applies classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and SGD Classifier, alongside hyperparameter tuning methods like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the models. Key features are:

### Key Features
- Data Generation: Creates a synthetic dataset with specified characteristics.
- Visualization: Includes 3D scatter plots to visualize the generated data.
- Model Training: Implements Logistic Regression and SGD Classifier for classification.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to find the best model parameters.

This notebook is a comprehensive guide for understanding dataset creation, model training, and hyperparameter optimization using Scikit-learn.

## Question 2
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates importing, preprocessing, and classifying data from the CWRU Bearing dataset. The notebook includes steps for converting time series data to tabular format, extracting statistical features, and applying various preprocessing techniques. A Logistic Regression model is then trained for binary classification, and performance metrics are calculated to validate the results.

### Key Features
- Data Import: Loads the CWRU Bearing dataset in .mat format.
- Data Conversion: Converts time series data into a tabular format suitable for machine learning.
- Feature Extraction: Applies statistical methods to extract meaningful features from the data.
- Preprocessing: Includes data shuffling, splitting, and normalization.
- Model Training: Implements Logistic Regression for binary classification.
- Validation: Uses various metrics to evaluate model performance on training and test sets.

This notebook provides a practical guide for handling time series data, preprocessing, feature extraction, and binary classification using logistic regression.
