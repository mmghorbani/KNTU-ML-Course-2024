## Mini-project 1

## Question 1
This notebook focused on generating and classifying synthetic datasets using various machine learning techniques. The notebook utilizes the make_classification function from scikit-learn to create a dataset with 1000 samples, 4 classes, and 3 features. It then applies classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and SGD Classifier, alongside hyperparameter tuning methods like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the models.

Data Generation: Creates a synthetic dataset with specified characteristics.
Visualization: Includes 3D scatter plots to visualize the generated data.
Model Training: Implements Logistic Regression and SGD Classifier for classification.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for finding the best model parameters.
This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding dataset creation, model training, and hyperparameter optimization using scikit-learn.
